\abstract{%
The venerable art of basket weaving has seen much development over the last 12000 years.
While the development of weaving submerged reeds is unequivocally recognized as the most profound development, here we discuss a less explored dimension of the field.
Defining a basket as braid which tiles a (potentially infinite) torus, we can analysis the behavior of a given braid's folding pattern across the topological space.
When braid density is fixed to the basis of the embedded vector-space, the periodicity of pattern repetition can be soundly compared between braids.
This measure is used to quantify the asymptotic complexity of a braid with $n$ cords with the length of it's repetition period.
Recursive braids offer the most insight regarding the applicability of the presented technique

\chapter{Introduction}

Before the gibberish ramblings, we must recognize the wonderful work of \cite{lipsum2014}, and it's contributions to the production of entropy.
